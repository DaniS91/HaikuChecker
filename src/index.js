// We could easily create many more.

// const hydrate = changeState("water")(1);
// const superWater = changeState("water")(5);

  // then update the output from the state
  


  // This function doesn't actually do anything useful in this application 
  // â€” it just demonstrates how we can "look" at the current state 
  // (which the DOM is holding anyway). 
  // However, students often do need the ability to see the current state 
  // without changing it so it's included here for reference.
  document.getElementById('show-state').onclick = function() {
    // We just need to call stateControl() without arguments 
    // to see our current state.
